 **Title: Deforestation rates in the Amazon forest through satellite images**

Abstract: This project aims to identify and quantify the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest using as an example 2 comparative images (2000 and 2017) from a NASA LANDSAT satellite, where each pixel represents an area of 0.09 ha or 900mÂ². This type of quantification where pixels are related to measurements is known as photogrammetry. The project has 3 important phases: the first is pre-processing where the aim is to improve the image (eliminating noise through filters). The second phase is to define regions of interest and extract them (segmentation). Finally, the third phase consists of generating a statistic comparing the established metrics.
